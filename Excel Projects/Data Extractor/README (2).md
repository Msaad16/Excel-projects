## Data Extraction using Excel VBA

This data extractor has been specially created for very small scale HR firms who cannot afford a full fledged database due to financial constraints. The extractor allows the HR recruiters to obtain a list of candidates who fulfill specific educational and skill requirements. The extactor works well for small databases. For representational pruposes dummy data of 3000 candidates is available along with the extractor.
